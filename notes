things i changed compared to original:

og: header margin top when site is wider than 1000px is set to 28px
mine: never add top margin to header

og: header font-family, line-height etc
mine: custom by me, hard to reproduce original

og: footer changes from col to row at >800px
mine: changing at >600px instead to be the same as header

optional: negative margin top/bottom on logo could be removed?

og: header navbar toggler is white/grey
mine: made it red based on the other red stuff

og: at >600 pixel expand menu in header
mine: using bootstraps md (>768px) for convenience

og: header menu has dark background inside (if open)
mine: i decided for dark layout and light inside

og: links in header menu
mine: dropdown, no top links

og: hover opens submenus
mine: click opens submenus, added arrow to indicate that there is a submenu hidden
